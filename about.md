Welcome!

I‚Äôm Xiangmeng Wang, a Ph.D. student at the School of Computer Science, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney (UTS). I enrolled in the UTS in March 2021. I am fortunate enough to have [Prof. Guandong Xu](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Guandong.Xu) as my supervisor and [Dr. Qian Li](https://sites.google.com/view/qian/) as my co-supervisor. Before that, I received my MSc degree in Computer Application Technology from Shanghai University. Currently, I've been a visiting student at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) by the student attachment program, advised by [Prof. Qing Li](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/prof-li-qing/). 

My research interests lie primarily in explainable artificial intelligence, data analysis, and causal machine learning. My papers have been published in top-tier conferences and journals in the field of machine learning.
