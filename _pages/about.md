Welcome!

I’m Xiangmeng Wang, a Ph.D. student at the School of Computer Science, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney (UTS). I enrolled in the UTS in March 2021. I am fortunate enough to have [Prof. Guandong Xu](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Guandong.Xu) as my supervisor and [Dr. Qian Li](https://sites.google.com/view/qian/) as my co-supervisor. Before that, I received my MSc degree in Computer Application Technology from Shanghai University.

My research interests lie primarily in explainable artificial intelligence, data analysis, and causal machine learning. My papers have been published in top-tier conferences and journals in the field of machine learning.
